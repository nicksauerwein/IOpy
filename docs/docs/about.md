# What is IOpy?
IOpy is a python based package for solving quantum Langevin equations. 


## Comments of Nick
In general I would try to make a story around these two usecases.
IOpy aims for:

* testing and visulizing of theorectical models 

* being an educational tool to learn about the classical effects in optomechanics 

As an eyecatcher, it maybe makes sense to show a very short example of IOpy on the about page. (You can use the simple cavity example. But don't add a lot of explanation. This you will do in the examples section)
Usually people (including me =) ) that want to use the software for the first time, just look at the first page to start.

Also try to make a short comment about the structure of IOpy. What are the important files? And link to the section that gives a more detailed description.

At the end you should have some links to installation and further examples.

Installation:

git pull
and also name all the packages that have to installed to use iopy:
numpy, scipy, matplotlib (These are all the classics)


# What you can do with IOpy?
Simulating networks of coupled harmonic oscillators.
